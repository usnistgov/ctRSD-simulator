2023 ACS Synthetic Biology Paper
================================

.. admonition:: Note:

   The scripts to simulate the results from the 2023 ACS Synthetic Biology paper (Schaffter et. al.), `Design approaches to expand the toolkit for building cotranscriptionally encoded RNA strand displacement circuits <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.01.526534v1>`_ can be found `here <https://github.com/usnistgov/ctRSD-simulator/blob/main/2023%20ACS%20Synthetic%20Biology%20manuscript/Scripts>`_ . See the paper for a detailed description of each experiment and/or simulation.

   In the paper a relatively weak output toehold (w) was used in some contexts. Gates with w output toeholds had their reverse strand displacement rate constant decreased compared to the default in *molecular_species()*.
